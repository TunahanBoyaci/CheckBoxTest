## Overview
This script demonstrates how to navigate through nested iframes, locate a checkbox, and interact with it using Selenium WebDriver. It's important to note that the BaseDriver class and the implementation of the waitAndQuit() method are not provided, so the complete functionality of the script relies on these missing components.
